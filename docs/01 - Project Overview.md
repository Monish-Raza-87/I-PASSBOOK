# 01 — Project Overview

## What It Is

**I-PASSBOOK** = **I**ndrones **P**roduct **A**fter-Sales **S**ummary **Book**

A Progressive Web App (PWA) for **Indrones** (Indian drone company) that serves as their product after-sales intelligence platform. It tracks, manages, and resolves **Information Reports (IRs)** — the company's internal term for customer service/repair tickets for drone products.

## Who Uses It

- **Warehouse staff** — receiving drones, doing inward checklists
- **IQC inspectors** — inspecting incoming units
- **Tech support engineers** — analyzing root causes, estimating repair costs
- **Production technicians** — performing rework
- **QC inspectors** — testing after rework
- **Test pilots** — flight testing repaired drones
- **PDI inspectors** — pre-delivery checks before shipping
- **Logistics staff** — dispatching units back to customers

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS | No framework, single `app.js` (~5,350 lines) |
| Styling | Hand-written CSS, layered, no build step | Frappe-derived design tokens, light + dark |
| Backend | Google Apps Script (GAS) | Deployed as web app, in `backend.gs` |
| Database | **JSON files in Google Drive** | `_store/` in the owner's Drive folder — accounts, sessions, access, every section, the audit trail. No spreadsheet holds app data (see [02](02 - Architecture & Data Flow.md)) |
| Sheets (inputs only) | Google Sheets — **read-only** | `Form Responses` for IR intake, the legacy workbook for the 🏛 Legacy view. Nothing is ever written to either |
| File Storage | Google Drive | Photos/files stored in `IR###/Section X` folders |
| Auth | Email + password, **admin-provisioned** | No self-signup; 30-day session token in `localStorage` (see [10](10 - Auth & Access Model.md)) |
| PWA | Service Worker + Manifest | Offline caching of static assets |

`style.css` no longer exists — it was replaced by the four layered stylesheets above
(see [09 — Design System](09 - Design System.md)).

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No build tools** — deployed as static files, no bundler/transpiler
2. **No npm** — zero dependencies, runs in browser directly
3. **Mobile-first** — designed for phone use by field/warehouse staff
4. **Demo mode** — falls back to 5 hardcoded sample IRs when GAS backend is unreachable
5. **Dev bypass** — `?dev=1` on localhost skips auth entirely
