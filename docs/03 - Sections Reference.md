# 03 — Sections Reference

All 9 passbook sections defined in `SECTIONS` object in `app.js` (line 291–436).

### Draft auto-preservation (all sections)
Any edit within a section is auto-persisted to `localStorage` as a draft keyed
`ipb_draft_<irNumber>_<sectionId>` (debounced on `input`, immediate on `change`).
On reopening an IR, after saved data loads, drafts are restored on top and a
banner ("You have unsaved entries restored…") offers **Discard restored drafts**.
A draft is cleared only on a successful Save (or via Discard). E-signatures are
included in the draft, so signing survives even if the section isn't saved
(signing also triggers an immediate draft write). Files/photos are not persisted
in the draft and must be re-attached.

---

## Comments / Tag system (app-wide)
Any signed-in user can **@-tag a teammate** to remind or assign them, at three
levels, available everywhere in the app. (Internally the data model is still
called "nudges" — the user-facing name is "Comments".)

- **Per IR** — `💬 Comments` button in the IR banner (scope `ir`).
- **Per section** — a `💬` button injected after each section title (scope `section`).
- **Per field** — a `💬` button on every field label (scope `field`, Sheets-like cell comments).

### Composing a comment
The Comments modal shows the existing thread for that context plus a composer:
- **Tag someone (@)** — type `@` or a few letters of a name/email; matching
  entries from the **Team Directory** appear as suggestions. **Keyboard-friendly:**
  ↑/↓ to move the highlight, **Enter** to select, **Esc** to close. A full email
  can also be typed directly.
- **Message** — free text.
- **💬 Comment** — a **single button** that posts the comment in-app **and** sends a
  real email automatically via the Apps Script backend (`MailApp.sendEmail`) —
  zero operator clicks, no in-app/email choice to make. If the backend is
  unreachable it falls back to a pre-filled mailto (operator clicks Send once).

### Delivery
- **In-app 🔔 bell** in the header shows a badge with the unread count of comments
  addressed to (or mentioning) the signed-in user. Opening the bell lists them
  (newest first) with **Open IR** and **✉️ Email** (re-send via backend, mailto
  fallback) actions, and marks them read.
- The bell polls the backend every ~90 s and refreshes on open.

### Backend (`backend.gs`) — comment email
The `sendNudgeEmail` POST action (name kept for contract stability) sends via
`MailApp.sendEmail`, restricted to `@indrones.com` recipients (so the app can't
be used to mail externally). The sender's email is set as `replyTo`. Email
subject/body read "you have a comment" / "mentioned you in a comment"
(no "nudge" wording). **Requires redeploying** the Apps Script web app after
adding this action. Quota: Apps Script's daily MailApp limit applies.

### Storage (no backend redeploy required)
Comments are stored via the existing generic `saveSection` / `getPassbook`
endpoints under a special irNumber `__NUDGES__` / sectionId `all`, field
`items` = array of:

```
{ id, irNumber, scope, sectionId?, fieldId?, sectionLabel?, fieldLabel?,
  to, from, fromName, message, mentions[], createdAt, readBy[] }
```

Adding a comment does a fresh fetch → append → save to reduce lost writes
(concurrent last-write-wins is still possible). All comments live in one
APP_DATA cell, so the list is bounded by the ~50,000-char cell limit (archive
later if it grows).

### Team Directory (admin-editable)
`TEAM_DIRECTORY_DEFAULTS` seeds the @-mention suggestions; admins
(`ADMIN_EMAILS` + dev) edit it via **⚙ Directory** in the bell panel. Overrides
persist to GAS under irNumber `__CONFIG__` / sectionId `team-directory`
(field `entries`) and to `localStorage` (`ipb_team_directory`).
`loadTeamDirectory()` runs at app start.

### Authorization — Section A (ALL fields restricted to CR team)
**Entire Section A** is editable only by authorized Customer Relations personnel:
- `monish.raza@indrones.com`
- `ravi@indrones.com`
- `adhik.nair@indrones.com`

All other users see every Section A field as **disabled** with a 🔒 icon. This is enforced both:
- **Frontend**: fields rendered with `disabled` attribute, "Add Row" button disabled
- **Backend** (`backend.gs`): `saveSection()` preserves existing values for all `sec-a` field IDs when `savedBy` is not in `AUTHORIZED_CR_EMAILS`

### Auto-Population from the IR Repository
Fields are pre-filled from the IDS/CR/007 sheet's **"Form Responses"** tab when an IR is opened:

| Section A Field | Form Responses Column | Config Key |
|---|---|---|
| `a_irNumber` | Col B — IR Number | `IR_REPO_IR_COL` |
| `a_droneId` | Col K — Mention the Drone Serial No (S250XX) | `IR_REPO_ID_COL` |
| `a_dateRaised` | Col I — Date of Incident | `IR_REPO_INCIDENT_COL` |
| `a_crmOwner` | Col F — SPOC | `IR_REPO_SPOC_COL` |
| `a_customerName` | Col L — Who's Reporting? | `IR_REPO_REPORTER_COL` |
| `a_contactEmail` | Col P — Email Address | `IR_REPO_EMAIL_COL` |
| `a_issueType` | Col G — What Support Is Required? | `IR_REPO_SUPPORT_COL` |
| `a_issueDesc` | Col H — Please Describe Your Problem... | `IR_REPO_DESC_COL` |
| `a_overallStatus` | Col D — Issue Status | `IR_REPO_STATUS_COL` |

### Activity Log Table Format
| Column | Field Class | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Day # | `.act-day` | Auto-incrementing number, readonly |
| Date | `.act-date` | Date picker, first row defaults to IR filing date |
| Activity Description | `.act-activity` | Free text |
| Remark | `.act-remark` | Free text |

- Starts with 5 empty rows
- "Add Row" button appends new row with next day number
- Data saved as JSON array: `[{dayCount, date, activity, remark}, ...]`
- Backward compatible: old textarea string data loads into first row's activity field

> **`a_overallStatus`** is the field read by `getAllIRStatuses()` in the backend to populate the status badge on the Master Index cards.

## Section B — Inward Checklist (Inventory)
**ID:** `sec-b`

| Field ID | Label | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `b_inwardDate` | Inward Date | date | |
| `b_inwardBy` | Inward By (Name) | text | Person who performed the inward |
| `b_stNo` | Stock Transfer (ST) No. | text | Assigned by Inventory |
| `b_inwardTable` | Particulars Received | inwardTable | 11-row table: Particular, Model/Value (dropdown or free text), Qty |
| `b_remarks` | Remarks | textarea | |
| `b_signInward` | Digital Signature — Inward Performed By | esignature | Email + timestamp; locked after signing |
| `b_signInventory` | Digital Signature — Inventory (ST No. Assigner) | esignature | Email + timestamp; locked after signing |

### Particulars table (`b_inwardTable`)
Saved as an object keyed by particular name: `{ "Air Vehicle": { model, qty, remark }, ... }`.
Each row has Model/Value, Qty, and a per-row Remark (an overall `b_remarks`
textarea is also at the bottom). 11 particulars from the IDS master Inward Checklist:

| # | Particular | Input | Option group |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Air Vehicle | dropdown | `airframe` |
| 2 | Battery | dropdown | `battery` |
| 3 | Charger | dropdown | `charger` |
| 4 | Radio Controller | dropdown | `rc` |
| 5 | Payload | dropdown | `payload` |
| 6 | Propeller | dropdown | `airframe` |
| 7 | Base | dropdown | `base` |
| 8 | Bag With Foam | dropdown | `airframe` |
| 9 | Tripod/Bipod | free text | — |
| 10 | Center Pole | free text | — |
| 11 | Toolkit-Box And Accessories | free text | — |

### Dropdown option groups (admin-customizable)
Defaults defined in `INWARD_OPTIONS_DEFAULTS` (`app.js`); admins
(`monish.raza@indrones.com`, `customer.relations@indrones.com`) edit them via the
**⚙ Manage Dropdown Options** button shown on the inward table. Overrides persist
to GAS under irNumber `__CONFIG__` / sectionId `inward-options` (shared) and to
`localStorage` (per-device fallback). `loadInwardOptions()` runs at app start.

| Group | Used by | Default options |
|---|---|---|
| `airframe` | Air Vehicle, Propeller, Bag With Foam | Sigma 25 Geo (S25G), Sigma 25 Pro (S25P), Sigma 75 (S75), Sigma 100 (S100), Fujin, Fighter, Talon, Striver, DID NOT COME |
| `battery` | Battery | 4S3P, 6S3P, 6S2P, 4S4P, LiPo 22000 mAh, LiPo 16000 mAh, 6S4P, DID NOT COME |
| `charger` | Charger | D2, Ultra Power, Hota, Sky RC, ISDT K2, DID NOT COME |
| `rc` | Radio Controller | Skydroid T12, Siyi MK15, Siyi MK32, DID NOT COME |
| `payload` | Payload | ADTI 24 mp, View Pro A609, Siyi A8 Mini, Share 5 Angle, Sony A6000, DID NOT COME |
| `base` | Base | Emlid RS2, Spectra SP85, Spectra SP60, DID NOT COME |

### E-signatures (`esignature` type)
Saved as `{ signedBy, signedAt, history: [{ signedBy, signedAt }, ...] }`.
- Signing captures the signed-in user's **email + full ISO timestamp** (displayed as `DD Month YYYY, HH:MM:SS`).
- Once signed, the field is **locked** — not editable, not deletable.
- An authorized user (inward admin / CR / the original signer) may **Override & Re-sign**; the previous value is pushed into `history`, which is shown on the block (and as a hover tooltip on the signed cell).
- `esignatureState` is reset each time a passbook is opened (`openPassbook`) and populated from saved data by `populateFieldValue`.

## Section C — IQC Visual Inspection
**ID:** `sec-c`

| Field ID | Label | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `c_iqcDate` | Inspection Date | date | |
| `c_iqcBy` | Inspected By | text | IQC inspector name |
| `c_evidenceLink` | Link to Evidence (Photo / Video) Folder | url | Folder link with "Open ↗" |
| `c_iqcTable` | Visual Inspection Checklist | iqcTable | Zone rows: Result (PASS/FAIL/NA) + per-row Remark |
| `c_remarks` | Remarks | textarea | Overall remarks at the bottom |
| `c_signIqc` | Digital Signature — IQC Inspector | esignature | Email + timestamp; locked after signing |

### Visual inspection checklist (`c_iqcTable`)
Saved as an object keyed by zone id: `{ "A1": { result, remark }, "D5I": { result, remark, name, checks }, ... }`.
Editable placeholder rows also store the inspector-entered `name` and `checks`.

Inspection zones (`IQC_ZONES` in `app.js`), grouped A–E:

| Group | Zone id | Code | Item | Visual checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A — Airframe | A1 | A.1. | All Four Arms | Cracks, Bends, Deformations, Loose Arms and Damage To Holes |
|  | A2 | A.2. | Air Vehicle Body | Damage, Crack, Scratch, Missing/Loose Screws, Loose Objects Inside |
|  | A3 | A.3. | Landing Gears/Legs | Damage |
| B — Propulsion | B1 | B.1. | All The Propellers | Chipping, Damage, Self-Tightening Bolts Are Intact |
|  | B2 | B.2. | All 4 Prop-Mounts | Bend, Bolts Are Tightened, Scratch |
|  | B3 | B.3. | All Four Motors | Deposit Of Dirt, Debris, Sign Of Impact, Scratch, Free to Rotate |
| C — Battery And Charger | C1 | C.1. | All The Batteries | Case Damage, Scratch, Missing/Loose Bolt, Voltage Check (Balance/Imbalance) |
|  | C2 | C.2. | Battery Bay | Damage, Looseness, Battery Connectors |
|  | C3 | C.3. | Battery Charger | Power On Test, Damage, Scratch, Loose Objects Inside, Power Cable |
| D — Avionics And Sensors | D1 | D.1. | GPS | Damage, Scratch |
|  | D2 | D.2. | Antennas | Missing, Damage, Scratch |
|  | D3 | D.3. | Dampeners | Damage, Scratch |
|  | D4 | D.4. | Radio Controller | Damage, Scratch, Charging Port, Loose Objects Inside, Power On Test and Screen Test |
|  | D5a | D.5. | ODS | Damage, Scratch |
|  | D5b | D.5. | Sensor/Payload | Damage, Scratch, Loose Objects Inside, SD Card Availability, Payload Cable And Connectors Are Intact |
|  | D5I / D5II / D5III | D.5.I / II / III | _(editable)_ | Inspector fills item name + checks |
| E — Accessories | E1 | E.1. | Base With Bag | Damage, Scratch, Missing Part (Antenna, Charging Cable), Power On Test |
|  | E2 | E.2. | Tripod/BiPod, Center Pole | Damage, Missing Part |
|  | E3 | E.3. | Drone Bag With Foam | Damage |
|  | E4 / E5 | E.4 / E.5. | _(editable)_ | Inspector fills item name + checks |

Each check row has a **Result** dropdown (`PASS` / `FAIL` / `NA`) and a **Remark** field.
The bottom `c_remarks` textarea holds overall remarks. The `c_signIqc` e-signature
follows the same locked + override-with-history behaviour as Section B (see
[`esignature` type](#e-signatures-esignature-type)).

### Admin customization (Section C)
Admins (`ADMIN_EMAILS` — `monish.raza@indrones.com`, `customer.relations@indrones.com`,
plus the `?dev=1` user for testing) see a **⚙ Manage Inspection Points & Dropdowns**
button under the IQC table. The modal edits:
- the **Result dropdown options** (one per line; defaults `PASS` / `FAIL` / `NA`),
- the **inspection points** themselves — each row's type (Header group / Check row /
  Editable blank), code, item/group name, and visual-checks text — with add/remove.

Changes persist to GAS under irNumber `__CONFIG__` / sectionId `iqc-config` (shared
across users) and to `localStorage` (per-device fallback); `loadIqcConfig()` runs at
app start and re-renders any open IQC table while preserving entered results/remarks.
Runtime state lives in `iqcZones` / `iqcResultOptions`; defaults are
`IQC_ZONES_DEFAULTS` / `IQC_RESULT_OPTIONS_DEFAULTS`. (Section B's inward options use
the same admin set — see `isAdmin()`.)

---

## Section D — Investigation
**ID:** `sec-d`

Section D is built in two parts, each signed off by a different role:
- **Part A — Investigation** (flight-data analysis) → signed off by the
  **Technical Support (QC Manager)**.
- **Part B — Cost Analysis** (repair estimate & lead time) → signed off by the
  **Purchase Manager**.

In the original I-PASSBOOK sheet the two signatures sit side-by-side; here they
are split — the QC Manager signature appears at the end of Part A and the
Purchase Manager signature at the end of Part B. The damage-report sub-section
from the sheet is deferred (later development).

### Part A — Investigation

| Field ID | Label | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `d_partA` | Part A — Investigation | divider | Sub-section heading band (no value) |
| `d_analysisBy` | Analysis Performed By | text | Engineer / analyst name |
| `d_analysisDate` | Analysis Date | date | |
| `d_intro` | _(none)_ | analysisNote | Read-only dynamic line: "Dear customer, analysis of **IRXXX** for your system with ID **XXXXX** has been completed. Its findings are as below." — `IRXXX` → `currentIR.irNumber`, `XXXXX` → `currentIR.droneId` |
| `d_investigation` | Description of Investigation | textarea | |
| `d_evidence` | Investigation Evidence (Images) | imageEvidence | Image-only, with a name/context caption per image (see below) |
| `d_rootCause` | Root Cause | textarea | |
| `d_correctiveAction` | Corrective Action | textarea | |
| `d_preventiveAction` | Preventive Action | textarea | |
| `d_signQcManager` | Digital Signature — Technical Support (QC Manager) | esignature | Closes Part A |

### Download Investigation (PDF)
A **⬇ Download Investigation (PDF)** button under the section builds a clean,
client-facing printable document (IR, system ID, date, analyst, the dynamic
intro, investigation, evidence images with captions, root cause / corrective /
preventive) and opens the browser print dialog so it can be saved/shared as PDF.
Newly-attached (not-yet-saved) images are embedded as data URLs; uploaded
images use their Drive URLs. **Part B (Cost Analysis) is excluded** from this
download. The document ends with an **Investigation Authorised** sign-off line
showing the Technical Support (QC Manager) name + date if Part A is already
signed, otherwise "Pending signature".

### Image evidence (`imageEvidence` type)
Each entry is an image plus a free-text **Name / context** caption. Control
state lives in `evidenceState[fieldId]` (reset on `openPassbook`):

```
evidenceState['d_evidence'] = [
  { caption, link, file, url },   // link = Drive URL ('' while pending); file/url = local File + object URL
  ...
]
```

- **Add:** `+ Add evidence image` opens an image-only picker (`accept="image/*"`,
  multiple). Each picked file is shown as a thumbnail with an editable caption
  and a ✕ remove button.
- **Saved value** (`d_evidence`) is an array `[{ caption, link }]` — captions
  paired with the Drive URLs of already-uploaded images; pending (not-yet-uploaded)
  images have `link: ''`.
- **Upload:** on Save, only the pending images are sent as files (fieldId
  `d_evidence`); the backend uploads them to Drive and stores the new URLs in
  `d_evidence_links` (comma-separated, in upload order). Already-uploaded links
  are carried in `d_evidence` and re-sent on every save, so they survive re-saves.
- **Link merge:** because the backend overwrites `d_evidence_links` with only the
  newest uploads, newly-uploaded URLs are merged back into `evidenceState` from
  `d_evidence_links` — on load (`populateFieldValue`) and immediately after a
  successful save (`refreshEvidenceLinksAfterSave`) — so captions stay paired
  with their images and a later caption-only re-save persists the URLs in
  `d_evidence`.
- **Drafts:** captions + already-uploaded links are included in the draft (like
  other fields); the local image files themselves are not (consistent with the
  all-sections note that files/photos must be re-attached).

### Part B — Cost Analysis (Repair Estimate & Lead Time)

Mirrors Section D Part B of the I-PASSBOOK sheet — the repair/replace estimate
columns (Particulars / Qty / Rate / Cost / Remark), the warranty qualification
question, the lead time, and the Purchase Manager sign-off.

| Field ID | Label | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `d_partB` | Part B — Cost Analysis (Repair Estimate & Lead Time) | divider | Sub-section heading band (no value) |
| `d_warrantyQualified` | Is This Repair Qualified For Cover Under Warranty? (Yes/No) | select | Options: _(blank)_, Yes, No. Label matches the Format worksheet row exactly |
| `d_repairTable` | Particulars For Repair / Replace | costTable | See the `costTable` type below |
| `d_leadTime` | Estimated Lead Time | text | e.g. "7–10 working days" |
| `d_goAhead` | Received Go Ahead By The Customer? | select | Options: _(blank)_, Yes, No. Customer approval of the estimate (Format tab row 55) |
| `d_signPurchaseManager` | Digital Signature — Purchase Manager | esignature | Closes Part B |

> **Note on Part B field types:** the Format worksheet's Section D region uses
> heavy cell-merging, so Google's public CSV endpoint blanks out most of the
> merged cells (the warranty row text and the input types aren't readable via
> the link-shared feed). Field labels and order were confirmed from the cells
> that *are* visible — the repair-table header (row 47: Particulars/Qty/Rate/
> Cost/Remark at U/W/X/Y/Z), "Received Go Ahead By The Customer" (row 55), and
> the two signatures (row 60: Technical Support (QC Manager) at U, Purchase
> Manager at X). The warranty, lead-time and go-ahead **input types** (select
> Yes/No vs. text vs. date) were inferred — if the sheet uses a different
> control for any of these, tell me and I'll adjust.

### Cost estimate table (`costTable` type)
A repeatable repair/replace estimate table mirroring the sheet's Part B layout:

| Column | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `#` | Read-only serial number (auto, re-numbered on row delete) |
| Particulars | Free text — the part / labour item |
| Qty | Number (≥0) |
| Rate | Number (≥0) — per-unit cost |
| Cost | **Auto** = Qty × Rate (read-only, recomputed on input) |
| Remark | Free text |
| ✕ | Remove row |

A **Total Repair Cost: ₹…** line sums Cost across all rows live. `+ Add Row`
appends a fresh row. **Saved value** is an array
`[{ particular, qty, rate, cost, remark }, ...]`; completely blank rows are
dropped on save. On load, saved rows are rebuilt (Cost re-computed); an empty
saved value re-seeds 3 blank rows so the operator always has inputs ready.
